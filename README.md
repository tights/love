# Before interfering
This is a shit example of a selfbot, just like my first one. i dont recommend using this

# Intro
Personal selfbot for myself and friends

## Installation
This requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

- After you've installed Node, all you need to do is start the hate.bat then it will automatically set everything up for you. Install modules then start itself.

## Help
The help is whatever you set your prefix to be.
